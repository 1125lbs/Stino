With this plugin, you can use Sublime Text 2 as IDE for developing Arduino projects. This Plugin provides most functionalities of Arduino IDE by an \"Arduino\" menu; and since Sublime Text 2 is a powerful editor, you will get better experience during the development. The main features are listed below:\r\n\r\n1. Editing, Compilation and Uploading as Arduino IDE.\r\n2. Multiple Selections.\r\n![Multiselections](http://www.kaixin.netii.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/091.png)\r\n3. Hilighting Arduino keywords.\r\n![Highlight](http://www.kaixin.netii.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/07.png)\r\n4. Auto-completing Arduino keywors.\r\n![Auto-completion](http://www.kaixin.netii.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/082.png)\r\n5. Supporting Arduino version >= 1.0 (1.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.5.1, not including 1.5.0)\r\n6. Multi-languages supported.\r\n![languages](http://www.kaixin.netii.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/101.png)\r\n7. Cross platform (Win/Linux/OSX).\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n1. Dowload the plugin form the website.\r\n2. Extract the __Stino__ folder and put it into Sublime Text 2 __packages directory__ . You can access the packages directory from the Sublime Text 2 menu ( __Preferences | Browse Packages...__ )\r\n\r\n### How to use this plugin?\r\n1. The Arduino Menu can be activated automatically or manually. If the file ypu are editting with a extention name of '.ino', the menu will appear. Or use __Preferences | Show Arduino Menu...__ to show the menu.\r\n![menu](http://www.kaixin.netii.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/011.png)\r\n2. Selecting the __Arduino directory__.\r\n![selection](http://www.kaixin.netii.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/021.png)\r\n![dialogue](http://www.kaixin.netii.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/031.png)\r\n![dialogue2](http://www.kaixin.netii.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/041.png)\r\n3. Editing your __Arduino Sketch__.\r\n4. Selecting board, processor, serial port and programmer if needed.\r\n![boards](http://www.kaixin.netii.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/051.png)\r\n5. Compilating or uploading your sketch.\r\n![output](http://www.kaixin.netii.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/061.png)\r\n\r\n### Translation\r\nIn the __lang__ directory, there are translation files. Currently, all these files are generated from Arduino Translations (http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/LanguagesIDE). The translation files' name is the abbravation of the language according  to the ISO standard (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). Each file contains a line started with \"LANG =\", and the Plugin will look for this line to generate language list. As the translation files are automatically generated, the translations are not complete. If you want to make the tranlation better, you can revise the translation and email the file to me.","google":"UA-37095082-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
